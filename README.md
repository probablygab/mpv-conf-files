# mpv conf files

My conf files for [mpv](https://mpv.io/). Tailored to Plex and [mpv.net](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net)

TL;DR mpv is an amazing player, Plex uses it, you can use it standalone or with mpv.net (has a GUI).

It offers wide support for most media, supports scripts, shaders and has great support for HDR and Dolby Vision (BL and RPU layers only, FEL and MEL are ignored).

AFAIK only madVR surpasses it when it comes to HDR tonemapping, but madVR requires and external player and is gimmicky sometimes.

Some more stuff:

## mpv.net with AnimeJanai

mpv.net used for real-time Anime/Cartoon Upscaling with [AnimeJanaiV3](https://github.com/the-database/mpv-upscale-2x_animejanai)
